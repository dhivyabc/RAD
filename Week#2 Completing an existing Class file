        Decimal: A number that includes a decimal point like 1.34 or 456.78907654
        String: Any set of characters surrounded by single quotes, like 'Apple' or 'I Love Strings' or '2 Legit 2 Quit'

        But that's enough to get us started.  Let's start by declaring some variables and initializing them with values

        // We are going to call this instance (aka: variable) "i" and we're going to initialize (aka: assign) this variable with the value 2.

        //ok, we told the computer that we are creating a variable that can hold any combination of characters.
        //Now we have a variable that is named mySampleString and which has stored the sentence you see above.
